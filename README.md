# Hi, I'm Kabir.

As an accomplished **Solution Architect** with over **half a decade** of experience, I specialize in designing, coding, and maintaining solution-centric systems that empower small businesses to grow and scale.
My main tools are, but are not limited to **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Go** and their various frameworks. I've developed multiple systems that currently handle thousands of users and process hundreds of orders per day, seamlessly incorporating multiple branches of business.

Let's create something amazing together! ðŸš€
